Tinystat is a SUPER BASIC free to use and Open Source metrics API used for counting user actions on a hourly basis. 

The need for a basic stat tracking system came while I was trying to display database statistics on a few of my personal web app projects.
The main issue had arisen when I was performing <code>COUNT</code> queries over very large data sets (6Million records).
The issue was that it would take several minutes to get a number to display to the user which is not acceptable.
This is even less ideal when it is required to retrieve an accurate record count in real time.
Rather than reproducing the same sort of polling-caching logic on every API I build I decided to write a service basic service with a single central database that would provide metrics tracking for all my projects in a simple and secure way.
By recording the total actions per hour (per record) in an actions table, we can easily query and <code>SUM</code> years worth of actions extremely quickly [as there should be no more than 8,760 records].

There are 3 simple endpoints:
- The CreateApp endpoint used once to create a new project and define a particular user (or application).
- The CreateAction endpoint which adds to a stored count for a particular hour
- The GetActionCount endpoint that recieveds time bounds and returns the number of actions that took place
